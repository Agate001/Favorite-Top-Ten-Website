// Input Peer Review: Daniel Herrera:
Your website looks very good with the styling. I would recommend adding a navbar in the bottom of your two pages with a function to scroll back to the top of the page, a link back to the home page and maybe a link to the other top 10. This will improve the UI so the user doesn't have to scroll all the way up the page.
You may need to take another look at responsiveness for intended effect. play around with col-md and col-lg. It looks good already with col-md.

PLZ fix:
Issues: Demon Slayer has a full metal alchemist trailer. Video needs to reflect with Demon slayer.
